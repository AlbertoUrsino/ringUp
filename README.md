# RingUp
Android application to make a phone ring at maximum volume even if DND is active and data connection is off.

## How does it work?
1. Download the app and set the phone's password.
2. Lose your phone, doesn't matter if you forgot to turn on data connection or if it's in DND and ring volume is at minimum.
3. Download the app on one of your friends' phone and let them set their password.
4. Use your friend's phone to send yourself a RingUp with the correct password.
5. Listen carefully for your phone's ringtone and find it.
